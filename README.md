# CUDA-Programming-Project
<p align="justify">
This project explores the Hadamard product, an element-wise multiplication of two matrices, leveraging CUDA for parallel execution on a GPU. Our implementation focuses on optimizing matrix computations using 2D/3D variables with shared memory, a key concept in CUDA programming that significantly enhances performance by reducing global memory access latency.
